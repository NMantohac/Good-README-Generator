# Good README.md Generator

## Description

A README.md generator that dynamically generates a README.md file after running **npm install** and **node index.js**. The user will then be asked a series of prompts (inquirer) to answer in regards to the topics and information on the README.md for display. In addition, the user's GitHub username will be asked, and then an axios API request is done to retrieve the user's GitHub profile, avatar image, and email in order to display them on the questions section of the generated README.md file.

The README.md generator is done through Javascript code in Visual Studio Code, and utilizes Node.js and npm. The entire GitHub repository contains several files (javascript/json) and a .gitignore file to avoid pushing certain files to the repo. Overall, the javascript files contains variables (const), functions (callback), and if-else statements. Also, npm installation was used in order to install Axios for the GitHub API request call, and Inquirer for the question prompts.

Technologies:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Javascript
  - Node.js
  - npm - Axios
  - npm - Inquirer
  - npm - Dotenv

Challenges:

It was definitely a notable experience to start working on the back-end (Node.js) compared to working on the front-end, which the previous homeworks and sessions have been before this week. I was able to stay on top of my game and was able to follow through with a lot of the logic and concepts around this homework, which made it a lot easier for me to do. I didn't really have a difficult time, and I enjoyed being able to implement the stuff that I have learned for this homework.

The only difficult issue that I had was a callback function to display the information I got from the GitHub API request into the generateMarkdown.js file. I had to request help from a TA, and after successfully implementing it, I was able to understand how and why it worked.

I had already learned a lot of the concepts regarding this homework, so it was really just about putting it into practice.

I was able to solve each of my problem through good time management, consistent effort, using my online resources (Stack Overflow and Class Recordings)!
